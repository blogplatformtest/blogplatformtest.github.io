This is the result of a crazy idea that came up whilst thinking about setting up my own blog. 
My *default* intention was to host it on [Worpdress.com](http://Wordpress.com), but some more research "uncovered" the recent trend of static blogging (or, should I say "revival" -  given that was how the initial pages on the Internet were served ;) 

The start of the trend came from Tom Preston-Wener's essay [Blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) and his creation of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). While the idea had some geeky appeal, what made it a real option was the existence of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - a place to host either an HTML site or, more interestingly, a Jekyll-powered blog.

As I was debating which approach would better fit my needs (and not reaching a conclusion!) I decided "let's try both and decide"... So this is the result. The basic idea is to set up two "mirror" blogs and see which I feel better about - and write about the experience!

The two "mirrors" are:

* Wordpress version: <https://blogplatformtest.wordpress.com/>
* GitHub Pages: <https://blogplatformtest.github.io/>
