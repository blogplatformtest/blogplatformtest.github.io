# Test importing note from Working Copy via Drobox

This file is written in nvAlt, sync to Dropbox and using Working Copy to import to GH

* Working Copy is "signed out" of GH after authorising and adding SSH keys...
	* A good thing
* Would that be a way to handle "different identities"?
	* More specifically, different "usernames" and "email addresses" like the "git config --local" allows
* how does push work?
